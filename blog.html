                    Last year I worked in a nursery for a few months. Since I often talked to my boss about my studies, he asked me to make a logo for him.

                                That was easier thought than done, however. The process dragged on for months. Now, after more than a year, the prints for the car are finally being produced. I didn't expect that it would be so time
                                consuming with all the correction loops. In the end, however, it was definitely worth it and Mr. Brandl now has a logo that represents him and his company very well.

                                I accepted the chlorine and ventured into the counterfeit. I have to say that I really enjoyed getting closer and closer to the original. The client was also very satisfied with the result. Since then I
                                finally paint more in my free time. mostly they are flowers in acrylic. If someone has a cool idea for a picture, I am always happy to receive such orders.
